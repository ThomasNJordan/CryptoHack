 === Euclid's GCD Algorithm === 
There are three different version of the algorithm to choose from:
1. Division, Modulo Based
2. Subtraction Based (Euclid's Original)
3. Recursive, Modulo Based

=== Euclid's Extended Algorithm ===
In addition to the Greatest Common Divisor, this
algorithm also computes the coefficents to BÃ©zout's identity:
ax + by = gcd(a, b); x,y \in \mathbb{R}

In Euclid's Algorithm we can ignore the quotient, here it
is quite important. 

I'm going to use parallel assignments, where (x,y) = (a,b)
means x = a, and y = b
